<h1>The best movies according to Wendy</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Bottoms </h3>
<p> Hilarious movie staring Ayo Edebiri. It ranks as the top because of how
    unfiltered it is. Defintley gives the vibes of an early 2000's movies. </p>

<h3> Barbie </h3>
<p> Very fun progressive movie. I enjoyed the aesthetics, the comedy and the overall
    message it had sent out. </p>

<h3> The Little Mermaid </h3>
<p> Astonishing movie with beautiful deatail, costuming and well writtened. I enjoyed
    how desversified it was and the disney princess nostalgia.</p>
